## Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate the code functionality and its quality.

**Code quality:**

- [SOLID design principles](https://realpython.com/solid-principles-python/).
- Use of static typing.
- FastAPI good practices.
- Pydantic schema validation
- Code modularity and reusability.
- Use of RESTful API endpoints.
- Project containerization with Docker.
- Testing
- Error handling.
- If you know what Domain-Driven design is, do it that way!
    - Separate API endpoints from business logic using services and from databases using repositories
- Keep code as pythonic as possible
- Do early returns
- Use inheritance where needed
- Use composition over inheritance
- Don’t hardcode values, for HTTP codes, [use this](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/status/).
